# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks commonly used in image and video processing. They are designed to automatically extract and learn features from the input images, making them well-suited for tasks such as object detection, recognition, and segmentation.

The main building blocks of a CNN are convolutional layers, which apply a set of learnable filters (also known as kernels or weights) to the input image. Each filter convolves over the input image, computing a dot product at each position to produce a feature map. These feature maps capture local patterns and structures within the image, such as edges, corners, and textures.

After the convolutional layers, the output feature maps are passed through one or more activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), to introduce non-linearity into the model. This is followed by pooling layers, which downsample the feature maps by taking the maximum or average value in a local region. Pooling helps reduce the spatial size of the feature maps, making the model more efficient and robust to small variations in the input image.

Finally, the resulting feature maps are flattened and passed through one or more fully connected layers, which compute the output probabilities or scores for each class in the classification task. The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss function between the predicted and actual outputs.
